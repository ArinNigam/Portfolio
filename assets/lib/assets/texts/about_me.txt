Welcome to my development journey! I'm Arin Nigam, a passionate Full Stack Developer skilled in a wide range of technologies. I thrive on challenges and enjoy problem-solving. I'm also an active contributor to the open-source community on GitHub. Let's connect! You’ll often find me with my laptop, tackling the daily LeetCode Challenge, fixing issues on GitHub, or hanging out with friends. Coding and development are my passions—I do both. I live in Navi Mumbai and love singing. Feel free to chat with me about cricket anytime. Now, I'm off to fix some errors, but in the meantime, check out my portfolio.
